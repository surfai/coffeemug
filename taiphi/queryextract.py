from statemachine import AgentState

def QueryExtract(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """
    Extract and process query information from the given agent state.

    This function is responsible for extracting query-related information from
    the input state and adding it to the state's message list. It appends the
    function name and a placeholder message for adding user and query information.

    Args:
        state (AgentState): The current state of the agent, containing information
                            about the ongoing conversation and processing.

    Returns:
        AgentState: The updated state with additional messages appended.

    Note:
        - This function currently adds placeholder messages and should be
          expanded to actually extract and add user and query information.
        - The exact format and content of the "add user+query" message should
          be defined based on the specific requirements of the system.

    Example:
        initial_state = AgentState(messages=[])
        updated_state = QueryExtract(initial_state)
        # updated_state.messages will now contain:
        # ["QueryExtract", "add user+query"]
    """
    state["messages"].append(QueryExtract.__name__)
    state["messages"].append("add user+query")
    return state
