def CallTaiphi(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """
    Call the Taiphi service and update the agent state with the results.

    This function is responsible for interacting with the Taiphi service,
    which is presumably an external AI or data processing system. It takes
    the current state of the agent, sends a request to Taiphi, and updates
    the state with the response.

    Args:
        state (AgentState): The current state of the agent. This object
            contains all the necessary information about the ongoing
            conversation and processing steps.

    Returns:
        AgentState: The updated state after calling Taiphi. This includes:
            - A new message indicating that CallTaiphi was executed.
            - A placeholder message for adding user query information.

    Note:
        This function currently adds placeholder messages to the state.
        In a full implementation, it would likely:
        1. Extract relevant information from the state to form a query.
        2. Send this query to the Taiphi service.
        3. Process the response from Taiphi.
        4. Update the state with the processed information.

    TODO:
        - Implement actual connection to Taiphi service.
        - Add error handling for network issues or service unavailability.
        - Include more detailed state updates based on Taiphi's response.
